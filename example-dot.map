# Mappings for your dotfiles
#
# The format of this file is:
#   - comments:
#     - lines starting with '#' are comments
#     - a comment must be on its own line
#     - there are no multi-line comments
#   - whitespace:
#     - whitespace is ignored, except inside a mapping definition
#        (i.e. you can indent lines however you like, and insert blank lines)
#   - mappings:
#     - a mapping definition is: "source: destination"
#     - source paths are relative to $DOTFILES (set in scripts/conf, or from an environment variable)
#     - lines that don't start with a '-' (dash) are top-level directories or files inside $DOTFILES
#     - lines starting with n number of '-' (dashes) are files/directories n levels deep
#         (i.e. '- bin' is one level deep, '-- bin' is two levels deep, etc.)
#     - every file/directory that is not at the root level must be under some top directory
#         (i.e. you can't have a line starting with '-' as the first line of the mapfile)
#     - every mapping source must exist (conf will complain if it doesn't)
#
# For example, the map definitions:
#   vim:
#     - vimrc: ~/.vimrc
#     - autoload:
#       -- script1.vim: ~/.vim/autoload/script1.vim
#       -- script2.vim: ~/.vim/autoload/script2.vim
#   tmux/tmux.conf: ~/.tmux.conf
#   ghci: ~/.ghci
#
# Get parsed as:
#   vim/vimrc => ~/.vimrc
#   vim/autoload/script1.vim => ~/.vim/autoload/script1.vim
#   vim/autoload/script2.vim => ~/.vim/autoload/script2.vim
#   tmux/tmux.conf => ~/.tmux.conf
#   ghci => ~/.ghci
#
# And executed as the commands:
#   ln -svf "$DOTFILES/vim/vimrc" "~/.vimrc"
#   ln -svf "$DOTFILES/vim/autoload/script1.vim" "~/.vim/autoload/script1.vim"
#   ln -svf "$DOTFILES/vim/autoload/script2.vim" "~/.vim/autoload/script2.vim"
#   ln -svf "$DOTFILES/tmux/tmux.conf" "~/.tmux.conf"
#   ln -svf "$DOTFILES/ghci" "~/.ghci"
#
# Every existing file will be backed up by appending the extension '.bak', before being overwritten.
# If a directory in the destination path doesn't exist, it is automatically created.
# `conf` doesn't remove empty directories after unlinking.
#
# The arrows "x => y" mean:
#   - "source => name_of_symlink"
#   - "the symbolic link to x is y"
#   - "y points to x"
#
# When linking/unlinking you either provide the name of the top directory,
#  or the full name of the mapped path.
